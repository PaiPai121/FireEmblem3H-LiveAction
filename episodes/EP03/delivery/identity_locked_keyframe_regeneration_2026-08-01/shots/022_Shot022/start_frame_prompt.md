Decision state: frames_pending. This prompt does not approve the frame; it creates a candidate for independent visual QA.

## Identity Locks First

Use the local selected/reference assets as hard identity and wardrobe sources. Preserve exact face read, age read, hairstyle, body type, academy-era costume topology, insignia, weapons, and role.

Named characters: Ashe, Lonato, Dimitri, Byleth
Character assets:
- `assets/characters/blue_lions/Ashe/academy/selected.png`
- `assets/characters/kingdom/Lonato/legacy_ep01/selected.png`
- `assets/characters/blue_lions/Dimitri/academy/selected.png`
- `assets/characters/protagonist/Byleth/professor/selected.png`

## Story And Frame Intent

Scene beat: Ashe 上前
Shot purpose: Ashe 主动要求对话，证明他不是被剧情拖着走。
Frame role: start
Frame intent: Establish the pre-action state for Ashe 上前; preserve geography from the source reference and keep the viewer's first read clear.
Action peak: Ashe 主动要求对话，证明他不是被剧情拖着走。
Blocking: Ashe 放低弓，走到 Byleth 允许的距离，Dimitri 半步跟住。
Screen direction: Maintain Blue Lions moving from lower/right foreground toward upper/left fog ridge unless the cathedral/monastery scene is static.
Camera: 正反打，中间始终留雾。
Audio anchor: Ashe, in Japanese: ロナート様、どうか止まってください。
Edit in/out: cut from Lonato reveal / cut to Lonato refusal

## Generation Direction

Create a cinematic live-action keyframe that integrates the local character identities into the EP03 environment with coherent lighting, scale, depth, and camera perspective. The image should feel like a film still, but it must not redesign any named character, costume, weapon, prop, or story beat.

Use restrained performance: show intention through eyeline, posture, breath, hand tension, and small facial changes. Avoid theatrical reaction faces.

## Must Preserve

- Exact local selected.png character identity and academy-era wardrobe topology.
- Exact local identity plate face crop, hair silhouette, body proportion, costume topology, and full-body outline for every named character.
- EP03 fog/cathedral geography, shot scale, and screen direction.
- The declared start frame intent and the start/key/end motion chain.
- Non-graphic, duty-focused, tragic tone.

## Reject If

- game UI or subtitles appear
- academy identities drift
- Lonato becomes a generic villain
- Ashe directly executes Lonato
- Any generated face no longer matches the listed local selected/reference assets.
- The image looks like a game screenshot, anime frame, UI capture, or generic fantasy cosplay.
- The shot adds new named characters, random soldiers as named-role substitutes, modern objects, subtitles, captions, or visible UI.
